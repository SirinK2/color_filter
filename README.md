# 🎨 Flutter Color Filter

A Flutter project that lets you create and transform colors using bitwise operations on RGB values.
Users can input their own Red, Green, Blue, and Opacity values (in Hex), then apply filters to generate new colors.

---

## 🚀 Features
- 🎨 Input custom RGBA values.
- 🔀 Apply bitwise operations (>>, ^, |) to transform RGB.
- 📋 Display the final hexadecimal color code.
- 🖼️ Preview both original and filtered colors side by side.
- 🔧 Simple UI with live updates.
